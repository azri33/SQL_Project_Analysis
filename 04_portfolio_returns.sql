-- Portfolio returns (one of my favorite parts of the analysis)
-- Using a CTE to store the temporary result
-- To calculate daily portfolio returns, I allocate my investment across 4 cryptocurrencies with a ratio of 4:3:2:1
-- By applying SUM, I combine the weighted returns to get the overall daily portfolio return
