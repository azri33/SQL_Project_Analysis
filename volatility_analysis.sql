-- Volatility helps us understand risk
-- High volatility = daily returns fluctuate a lot (less stable, higher risk & potential return)
-- Low volatility = daily returns are more stable (lower risk, slower growth)
-- We use a CTE called "returns" as a temporary table
-- Volatility is measured using standard deviation (STDDEV), which shows how much returns deviate from the average
-- To calculate annual volatility: multiply STDDEV(daily_return) by sqrt(365)
-- Note: Crypto trades 24/7, so we use 365 instead of 252
