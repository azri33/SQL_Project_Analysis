# SQL_Project_Analysis
## Overview
My first SQL project focused on analyzing the performance of a cryptocurrency investment portfolio. I chose SQL to apply the concepts I had learned to real-world data sets, strengthening my practical skills and overall understanding. 

Using historical daily price data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, I was able to evaluate the portfolio's returns, volatility, cumulative growth, and risk-adjusted performance.

## 📖 Project Overview
- Raw data source: Investing.com
- Frequency: Daily
- Period: 1 January 2021 – 31 December 2024 (4 YEARS)
> (Captures multiple market conditions, including bull, bear, and consolidation phases)
- Assets: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP

## 🏗️ Tools Used
- SQL (window functions, CTEs, aggregations)
- SQLite / MySQL
- Excel (data cleaning)
- Power BI (visualization)

## 🎯 Key Analysis and project goals
- Daily returns of each cryptocurrency using SQL window functions
- Annualized volatility (365-day assumption)
- Portfolio-level weighted returns
- Cumulative portfolio growth      
- Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted performance 

## 🌟 Key Insights 
- BTC provided the lowest volatility among selected assets
- SOL delivered higher returns but significantly higher risk
- Portfolio diversification reduced overall volatility compared to individual assets
